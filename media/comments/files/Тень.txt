yes, yes,
every person carries a shadow in himself, and the less it is embodied in the conscious life of an individual, the
blacker and denser it is; if inferiority is conscious, a person always has a chance to correct it But if
it is suppressed, isolated Awareness It will never be corrected And it can suddenly break out
into a moment of unconsciousness in any case, it forms an unconscious snag that interferes with our
best intentions Carl Yun talks about two types of shadows the personal shadow The Unknown Dark Side of
Our Personality and the Collective Shadow The Unknown Dark Side of Society Starting with the personal shadow
Jung calls it what a person does not want to be she represents it is the sum of all the unpleasant
qualities
that we prefer to hide ourselves the shadow contains the imperfections that everyone has
but which we prefer not to know They seem weak socially unacceptable or even evil
the shadow is most noticeable when a person is In the grip of anxiety or other emotions under the influence of
alcohol and other substances, he can suddenly issue a hostile remark during a friendly conversation
when we do not want to internalize what we despise we project it onto others It is possible that
a person is familiar with his shadow and is partially aware of it, that is is under the control of the Magician many
people However refuse to recognize their shadow so completely that the ego is not even aware of the behavior of
the shadow And therefore is not able to control it autonomously in such conditions of the shadow
and can be expressed in inexplicable moods of irritability and cruelty throughout
its work speaks of the importance the development of consciousness of the shadow of psychotherapy in life although the shadow
is usually perceived as a negative phenomenon, it can be positive in fact, the study of its
shadow gives us access to many positive qualities Jung writes that the shadow shows a number of
good qualities such as normal instincts, appropriate reactions, realistic insights,
creative impulses, and so further, one of Jung's closest collaborators, Maria Louise von Franz, writes that the shadow is
not necessarily always an adversary, in fact, it is exactly the same as any other
person with whom you have to get along sometimes yielding sometimes resisting sometimes showing love depending
on the situation, the shadow becomes hostile only when it is ignored or not understood
the day contains all sorts of qualities, strengths or potentials that if
left unexplored leads our personality to a state of impoverishment creating unconscious growth
and embodiment of these good qualities present in our psyche for example a person may consider that being
assertive means being rude or aggressive losing at these qualities such as confidence
and the ability to honestly and respectfully speak for oneself which in turn can lead to
a decrease in initiative make it difficult to get a promotion or promotion cause
difficulties with money and so on, so when a person faces an assertive person
at heart, he feels resentment or guilt What makes his shadow blacker and thicker
these valuable aspects must be assimilated in real experience and not suppressed must give up
his pride We also encounter our shadow in our dreams to see a person of the same gender
that the Clairvoyant is what seems to be a criticism of our character and unconscious inner judge
of your own being that reproaches you the result is usually an embarrassed
silence we have to determine the content of the shadow integrate it into our consciousness personality
sunday also known as shadow work
shadow negotiation work can be said
to be the psychological equivalent of the exploits of Hercules thanks to shadow work a person can
observe his shadow externally By observing his emotional reactions and being radically
honest in his interactions with others and inwardly exploring his dreams This allows one to become
enlightened and reduce the destructive potential of the shadow not so much a war with
darkness as it could bring light to darkness, as Jung writes, there is no light without a shadow and there is no psychic
integrity without imperfection; one must strive not for perfection, but for the integrity of the personality
continuing throughout life between the conscious and unconscious spheres of a person, bringing
the totality of his personality, no matter how scary or gloomy it is to confront his shadow, the search for truth
brings relief the search for truth is a process of authenticity painstakingly digging into the depths
of our being in order to explore the possibilities and limitations of distortions and hidden often forgotten
parts of us of ourselves and our abilities However, most people are too lazy to
think deeply even about those moral aspects of their behavior that they are aware of, not to
mention considering how they are influenced without consciousness shadow can also
consist of factors that come from a source not related to personal life of man here we
encounter the collective shadow the dark side unknown or little known aspects of society
and culture It consists of what opposes our common collective values ​​the collective
shadow This is a huge multidimensional often life terrifying immeasurable harm caused by people to each other
and the natural world and the huge consequences of this harm for subsequent of generations The collective shadow
manifests itself In the projection of darkness and inferiority and oppression in the invisibility of current
suffering In the denial of current responsibility The collective shadow can manifest itself in brutal
Wars of massacres and egenocides But it can also hide under the often attractive disguise
of missionary activity, for example, in the obligatory use of certain
languages ​​Oryol reality that We we are currently experiencing as it is characteristic of any shadow
matter Be individual or its collective existence and its influence can be ubiquitous and
not obvious The collective shadow is manifested by external cruelty persecution of physical suffering diseases
of poverty malnutrition alcoholism crime of the death of culture and so on It
can also manifest itself more internally in the complexities of the individual psyche as Self-hatred one
's heritage one's culture depression a feeling of powerlessness a desire to take revenge for others to experience
something similar to their pain The collective shadow is what has historically been called the evil of the Christian
tradition is the devil one who is possessed by the devil loses his human qualities and becomes
demonic in nature primary reactions out of spite according to Jung there must be a desire for self-knowledge
for integrity, which implies the assimilation of shadow material, the individual must tirelessly
know how much
good he can do And what crimes he is capable of
. collective responsibility therefore taking responsibility
is of particular importance
it frees others from having to bear it for us e.g. responding to massive
historical suffering warriors genocide the holocaust widespread oppression and so on, the consequences
of which still persist for us as people there is much to learn in this regard denial is
often associated with the desire to live on and leave
the past behind seems to be the most common
approach and as a rule of first reaction there are many attempts to cope
with a difficult painful past by public apologies for supporting atrocities
shadow integration has taken place deep and wide within the population they are simply on
a symbolic level through leaders and politics remembering and talking about what often seems
inexpressible it is an inevitably painful process for victims and perpetrators eyewitnesses and Witnesses any
such process is considered successful or sufficiently complete only after the pain indignation
, betrayal, suffering, and all other feelings will be expressed and the responsibility for
them will be heard, the utterance of the Truth will be taken upon oneself, this is both the most desired and the most real way
to cope with a difficult past one of the examples of a terrible mass psychosis represented by
a collective shadow is Nazi Germany, where people through their personal shadow
fell into a demonic nature they joined the Nazi party and did worse things
than they could imagine or would have done under normal social conditions in this
In a sense, the personal shadow is a bridge to the collective shadows, so it is important to first resolve your internal
conflicts so as not to fall unconsciously under the influence of the collective shadow, later a person
can influence other people and society as a whole will become better if we practice
mindfulness, we will learn How to look deeply into the nature of war and having begun to wake people up in order to
avoid repeating the same horrors again and again, there is a war in us But it is in everyone
everything is ready to explode and we all bear joint responsibility for this Summing up, we can
say that in order not to become a passive victim of our shadow and our unconscious
projections, we must first recognize our personal shadow and enter into long difficult negotiations with it
be honest with ourselves with others observe our emotional reactions and explore
our dreams That will allow us to rescue the good qualities dormant in us that improve our lives and
the lives of those around us we we can consciously be aware of the collective shadow not fall
prey to it and take responsibility for solving the problem of denial of important issues and
the lack of individual collective initiative the courage to bear our darkness brings relief
to others because telling the truth is the most desirable way to cope with the difficult so that
the shadow becomes blacker until it can grow bigger and then history repeats itself [music]
